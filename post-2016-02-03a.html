<H2>2016-02-03 : Guitar project final piece</H2>

<p> I got the final piece for my guitar effects project - a step up converter so that I can power a 5v USB hub from a 3.7v LiPo battery. I got <a href="http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/131672628691">this</a> that arrived quickly and works. </p>

<p> I can now power my Ainol 7 Paladin tablet and my <a href="http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/Electric-Guitar-Link-to-USB-Interface-Cable-for-MAC-PC-MP3-Recording-Adapter-/131317777152">guitar usb ADC</a> from 3 x <a href="http://www.tmart.com/4pcs-Ultra-Fire-18650-3.7V-5000mAH-Lithium-Rechargeable-Battery-18650-Battery_p263285.html">18650 3.7v Lithium batteries</a>. </p>

<p> This is the first time I've managed to run all the hardware together, so it this first time I've noticed that running jackd on the tablet causes a load of xruns. </p>

<p> I fear the next step is to apply the linux RT patch to the jz4770 kernel </p>
