Guitar project final piece
==========================

I got the final piece for my guitar effects project - a step up converter so that I can power a 5v USB hub from a 3.7v LiPo battery. I got `this

I can now power my Ainol 7 Paladin tablet and my `guitar usb ADC
<http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/Electric-Guitar-Link-to-USB-Interface-Cable-for-MAC-PC-MP3-Recording-Adapter-/131317777152">`_ from 3 x `18650 3.7v Lithium batteries

This is the first time I've managed to run all the hardware together, so it this first time I've noticed that running jackd on the tablet causes a load of xruns.

I fear the next step is to apply the linux RT patch to the jz4770 kernel
