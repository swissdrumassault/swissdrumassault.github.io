<H2> 2016-02-05 : Linux Ainol Novo 7  </H2>

<p> A few years ago I bough a few incredibly cheap MIPS tablets, made by a Chinese company called, rather unfortunatly, Ainol. The varients I got seem to be called Novo 7 and contain Ingenic Xburst jz7440 systems, based on npm702. </p>

<p> /proc/cpuinfo says: </p>

<p>I have found two useful blogs about these machines, one <a target="_top" href="http://suz-aa1.sblo.jp/article/54697897.html">Japanese</a>, one <a target="_top" href="http://a320.emulate.su/2012/05/14/mini-obzor-planshet-ainol-novo7-paladin-i-processor-jz4770/">Russian</a>.</p>

<p>I have managed to produce a kernel that can be booted on these boards, but I can't remember exactly where I got the source from. The Japanese AspireOne blog includes some links to patches to kernel 3.0.23 which match the version that I have source for. There's also an android custom rom by someone called "pinkflodz".</p>

<p>This can be cross compiled (with one caveat) and installed via clockworkmod (which was already installed as the android recovery system on the tablets I got). The caveat is that there is some confusion in my tool chain (gcc 4.8.3) as to what opcodes can be used. This can be fixed by adding a pre-processing step to cc1.  </p>

<p> Move /usr/libexec/gcc/mipsel-linux-uclibc/4.8.3/cc1 to /usr/libexec/gcc/mipsel-linux-uclibc/4.8.3/cc1.orig and replace cc1 with this script </p>

<pre><code>
#!/bin/sh

DIR=/usr/libexec/gcc/mipsel-linux-uclibc/4.8.3

$DIR/cc1.orig $* > /tmp/$$-xxx
egrep -i '(S32I2M|S32M2I)' /tmp/$$-xxx > /dev/null
if [ $? == 0 ]; then
  $DIR/mxu_as < /tmp/$$-xxx
else
  cat /tmp/$$-xxx
fi
rm -f /tmp/$$-xxx
</code></pre>

<p> (I got this from the <a href="http://suz-aa1.sblo.jp/article/38304175.html" target="_top">AspireOne blog</a>. Thank you.)</p>

<p> There's also a slight issue with the wifi. I couldn't get the dhd.ko from the kernel source to work properly, so had to use the one I got from pinkflodz's rom (I think). This requires a bit of firmware (again taken from the rom) and for the filenames to be passed to the module when inserted, e.g.

<pre><code>
insmod /lib/modules/3.0.21/dhd.ko firmware_path=/gentoo/lib/firmware/fw_iw8101.bin nvram_path=/gentoo/lib/firmware/nvram_iw8101.txt 
</code></pre>

<p> Luckily 3.0.21 and 3.0.23 are similar enough that this works. </p>

<p> I was also able to get the abd from the rom to work with linux. So that, if the wifi doesn't work, you can plug it in and use the normal android abd to get a shell over USB. </p>

<pre><code>
