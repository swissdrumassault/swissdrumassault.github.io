<h2>A 45 degree Styrofoam cutting jig</h2>
<p>I was reading an old Warhammer book and saw a really good castle. It was pretty much <a href="http://www.roundtable-bretonnia.org/index.php?option=com_fireboard&Itemid=1&func=view&catid=4&id=127253">this</a> one (he&apos;s read the same book, had the same idea and executed it pretty much flawlessly).</p>
<p>I thought I&apos;d have a bit of a go making one out of 5mm Styrofoam. The results of my first practice tower were not great.</p>
<img src="pictures/bad_castle.jpg"><br/>
<br/>
<p>My biggest problem was that I found it very difficult cutting the edges square, as in - holding the knife exactly vertical as I made the cut. &quot;I know&quot;, I thought, &quot;I&apos;ll cut beveled edges, and hide away the lack of accuracy when I glue it&quot;. As the picture above demonstrates, that didn&apos;t work. I managed to cut the bevels so far away from 45 degrees (and with added waviness) that I had no chance of the edges even meeting in a straight line. Also, the poor cutting meant that getting it square was pretty much impossible. </p>
<p>This produced a non-square tower with big wobbly gaps down the corners.</p>
<p>I researched 45 degree cutters. The best I could up with was <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/WC6010-Foamwerks-Foamboard-Straight-Cutter/dp/B001JSQX3K">this</a> foam board cutter, which looks OK but is £8.57 (which is £7.57 more than I really wanted to pay) and would take nearly a month to arrive.</p>
<p>Instead I went to Tesco and bought two packs of Ralston Stanley knife blades for £1.45. Together with some Meccano I then tried to make something that looked like the foam board cutter.</p>
<p>Sadly, the small amount of Meccano I had, and the inability to mount the blade on a sliding mounting (like the foam board cutter has) meant that every design had to be quite tall (and hence difficult to keep straight) and had a big gap between the blade and the flat bit of the tool, meaning that cutting small bits would be difficult.</p>
<p>I then turned to my hot wire cutter and modified it to cut 45 degree cuts. This wasn&apos;t too hard, but meant that switching between 45 degrees and 90 degrees (i.e. straight up) would be a bit of an effort. Also, the reason that I didn&apos;t want to use the hot wire to cut these walls in the first place is that, however hard I try, I end up with slight striations on the cut surface, due to me not pushing the piece in totally straight.</p>
<p>My next idea was to put a guide on the hot wire cutter to try and prevent this.</p>
<p>It then occurred to me that I could make a similar arrangement, but with one of the blades rather than the wire. I could make the cutty bit static, while I moved the Styrofoam. In this configuration, it would be much easier to use the Meccano to mount the blade at the right angle, and because the blade didn&apos;t need to be connected at both ends (like a hot wire does), it would be much easier to make something that could easily switch between 45 and 90 degrees.</p>
<p>I took a bit of old chip board and cut a square hole in it. I mounted the blade on a bit wood the same size as the hole and glued a bit of thin MDF to the bottom. I then cut long guide holes and mounted a guide on them using bolts and wing nuts. Viola,</p>

<br/>
<p>This close up shows how I used a bit of Meccano with 45 degree edges to mount the blade.</p>

<br/>
<p>A similar method makes the 90 degree cutter,</p>

<br/>
<p>Now to actually use it to make a castle.</p>
